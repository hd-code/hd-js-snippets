# hd-snippets-js

This repo just contains a collection of very helpful JS functions that I use again and again in several projects. There are browser as well as node.js snippets.

## Structure

* `build` contains the transpiled JS code.
* `src` contains all the snippets source code.
* `test` contains tests for all the code snippets.

### TODOs:

[x] setup test environment
[ ] switch all to typescript
[ ] write tests for all in src

## Development

Make sure to update the version number in `package.json` and run `npm run build` before committing changes. That way `build` will always contain the latest build versions.
