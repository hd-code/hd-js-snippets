# hd-snippets-js

This repo just contains a collection of very helpful JS functions that I use again and again in several projects. There are browser as well as node.js snippets.

## Structure

* `build` contains the transpiled JS code.
* `src` contains all the snippets.
* `test` should in the future contain tests for the code snippets.

### TODOs:

* switch all to typescript
* setup test environment
